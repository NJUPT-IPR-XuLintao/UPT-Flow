# UPT-Flow: Multi-Scale Transformer-Guided Normalizing Flow for Low-Light Image Enhancement

This is the official PyTorch code for the paper "UPT-Flow: A Multi-Scale Transformer-Guided Normalizing Flow for Low-Light Image Enhancement". The paper has been submitted for review.

> **Abstract:** Low-light images often suffer from information loss and RGB value degradation due to extremely low or nonuniform lighting conditions. Many existing methods primarily focus on optimizing the appearance distance between the enhanced image and the ground truth, while neglecting the explicit modeling of information loss regions or incorrect information points in low-light images. To address this, this paper proposes an RGB value Unbalanced Points-guided multi-scale Transformer-based conditional normalizing Flow (UPT-Flow) for low-light image enhancement. We design an unbalanced point map prior based on the differences in the proportion of RGB values for each pixel in the image, which is used to modify traditional self-attention and mitigate the negative effects of areas with information distortion in the attention calculation. The Multi-Scale Transformer (MSFormer) is composed of several global-local transformer blocks, which encode rich global contextual information and local fine-grained details for conditional normalizing flow. In the invertible network of flow, we design cross-coupling conditional affine layers based on channel and spatial attention, enhancing the expressive power of a single flow step. Without bells and whistles, extensive experiments on low-light image enhancement, night traffic monitoring enhancement, low-light object detection, and nighttime image segmentation have demonstrated that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across a variety of real-world scenes.

## üîç Testing

Pre-trained models for 6 datasets can be obtained from [Google Cloud Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kc1gYk3oTNkV-wZuqUjcZDNbZXqwq5Np?usp=sharing)

1„ÄÅModify the paths to dataset and pre-trained mode. You need to modify the following path in the config files in `./confs`
```python
#### Test Settings
dataroot_unpaired: 
dataroot_GT: Put high-light images  
dataroot_LR: Put low-light images
model_path: Put pre-trained model
```

2„ÄÅTest the model

To test the model with paired data and obtain the evaluation results, e.g., PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. You need to specify the data path ```dataroot_LR```, ```dataroot_GT```, and model path ```model_path``` in the config file. Then run
```bash
python test.py --opt your_config_path
# You need to specify an appropriate config file since it stores the config of the model, e.g., the number of layers.
```


## üîç Results

We achieved state-of-the-art performance on *low-light image enhancement*, *night traffic monitoring enhancement*, *low-light object detection* and *Nighttime semantic segmentation*. More results can be found in the paper.
